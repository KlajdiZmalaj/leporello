            Lefkada (Laws 4019/2011 and 4430/2016) and was born out of our love

          Matina Spyrou, Georgia Lazari, Anastasia Foteinou, Konstantina
          Skiadaresi and Andriana Lazari! Each has a special love for the
          cultural elements of our homeland. Our aim is to convey this love to
          visitors and to the inhabitants of our island <br />
          <br />
          <b>Services:</b> organization of seminars and workshops; highlighting
          and promoting local culture <br /><br />
          <b>Objective:</b> creation of a cultural space in which the spiritual
          culture of Lefkada will be promoted through the organization of
          seminars and workshops <br /><br />
          <b>About us:</b> At THE TRIP we love culture and tradition and we
          decided to do what we love, artisanal work! This is because we believe
          that only when you really love your job can you stand out and be the
          best! Tradition is a process by which morals, customs, knowledge or
          beliefs are passed on from one generation to another and thus
          perpetuated. The cultural elements - tastes, music, arts, crafts - are
          what make each people special and distinctive. Our island, Lefkada, is
          rich in all of these, and they enchant all those who experience them!
          The focus of our business is the promotion of cultural elements to
          visitors to our island through training tourism, experience and
          adventure tourism and through the many and varied aspects of
          alternative Thematic Tourism. The key purpose of our team is to
          publicise and promote Lefkada’s local products and those who produce
          them. By achieving our goals we will also enable our members to
          achieve fulfilment! Join our TRIP to tradition!

            <b>Target:</b> Our main goal is to facilitate the production and
            distribution of cultural goods while satisfying the interests and
            needs of the local community of Kefalonia. For the purpose of
            maintaining team work and social cohesion, seminars, workshops and
            educational activities for all ages will be organised and artist
            residencies will be offered. We want to build an artistic network
            that will support local art workers and enhance international
            collaboration in line with the principles of sustainable economics
            and alternative tourism development. <br />
            <br />
            As far as our mosaic work is concerned, we will organise workshops,
            educational programmes and seminars on the history and evolution of
            mosaic art and help new artists to design and create mosaic
            artworks. Mosaics have a long tradition on the island of Kefalonia,
            dating back to Roman times, and, because of its aesthetic, social
            and historical value, engagement with this art form can serve not
            only to influence local artistic production but also to improve
            cohesion in the local community. The artists will use traditional
            mosaic techniques and take account of contemporary trends in the
            field in order to create authentic new works by combining methods
            and materials, thus offering a new perspective on this ancient art
            form. We intend to design and create works of art which can decorate
            commercial or private residential spaces, but what excites us most
            is incorporating mosaic art into public environments, as outdoor
            mosaic projects can transform crowded public areas into creative
            dialogue platforms. <br /><br /><b>About us: </b> Lithostroto is a
            new creative hub, a cultural cooperative located in Argostoli,
            Kefalonia. The main goal of our start-up is to encourage artistic
            expression in any form and in any way possible! We will engage
            mostly with the art of mosaics, but we are more than eager to
            support all kinds of cultural events, exhibitions and educational
            projects, all of which can be planned, staged and managed by our
            team!

          <br />
          <b>About us:</b> Le Moire is a group that uses textiles and weaving
          (in Ancient Greece the Moirai were the goddesses who spun the thread
          of life; for the Romans they were known as the Parcae) to produce
          clothes and accessories inspired by the Mediterranean and Magna
          Graecia, areas historically bound together by a shared past. They make
          garments with elements that customers can add on or interchange as
          they wish. Customers can choose to personalise garments from the basic
          clothing line (designed and packaged by the Moire) by adding pockets,
          collars, sleeves, etc (made on a loom with recycled textiles), all of
          which operations can be easily performed even by those less expert.
          The group organises courses aimed at passing down the traditions of
          their land, such as weaving, and passing on their knowledge in the
          artistic and other fields to all those interested.

          clay both by hand and by technological means (3D printing, laser,
          etc..), Cave Studio seeks to provide those already operating in the
          sector and the public at large with products and unique experiences in
          artistic and artisanal workshops. Through an exchange programme
          between local artists and artisans, Cave Studio operates as an open
          atelier both at a national and international level. Tourists and
          professionals will be able to experience a hands-on approach to the
          wonderful art of ceramics-making. It will be possible to rent a
          workspace monthly or to take part in any of the numerous courses that
          the collective organises.  Objectives: originality and uniqueness of
          products, sustainable production, distribution on an international
          scale of products for customers, research connected to contemporary
          ceramic production, establishing links with local and international

            <b>About us:</b> CAVE STUDIO (the name provides an echo of the
            primitive identity of Grottaglie, the ceramics town) is a
            contemporary artistic ceramics atelier. Our aim is to explore,
            through the ceramic craft, new languages and modes of expression
            connected to the production of originally-designed objects in
            various fields such as jewellery, sculpture, decoration and art.
            Thanks to the Interreg Italy-Greece “Craft Lab” project, the
            collective has been assigned a space inside the former monastery of
            the Capuchin monks in Grottaglie. With its range of equipment this
            workshop will enable us to begin producing ceramic artefacts that
            conform to the traditional and contemporary criteria for art and
            craft. The Grottaglie area is an important
          </div>
          <div>
            and charming tourist destination which lends itself to dynamic
            interaction between the atelier, the local area, the artisans and
            tourists; Cave Studio will therefore be a place for meeting and
            exchange, for establishing solid neighbourly relations with the
            ceramics quarter, where ceramicists of varying artistic identities
            have plied their trade in their workshops for centuries, and for
            culturally enriching the young artists who will come to work there.
            Designers and artisans who do not have access to a place where they
            can express their creativity will be able to take advantage of our
            premises and equipment as well as of the know-how of the various
            members of the collective, with a view to developing their own line
            of products, which will become a basis for cultural exchange.

            workshops. <br />
            <b>About us:</b> the products will be developed in line with the
            principle of bringing disused and waste materials back into
            circulation. Our main aim is the reclamation of objects and
            furnishing items with a view to remarketing them with a more
            eye-catching appearance, taking account of contemporary trends in
            the design market. The products to be marketed are objects and
            furnishing accessories crafted with an innovative mosaic technique
            that involves the use, as the key element in the tiling finish, of
            waste material produced by locally-operating businesses. Customers
            will be offered expert advice on the “regeneration” of furnishings
            and on the crafting they require, and will be able to tap into our
            know-how in the artisanal and DIY fields, the aim being to develop a
            greater awareness of eco-sustainability and to promote enlightened
            consumption.
