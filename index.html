          In many European regions artisanal culture has a long tradition. In
          order to be able to safeguard both Italian and Greek cultural and
          artistic heritage, it is necessary to protect the professions
          connected to culture and traditional craft and to incentivise the
          future development of the cultural and creative industries.  The
          ancient trades have been passed down from generation to generation,
          more in the shape of creative hobbies than entrepreneurial activities.
          This is the background to the CRAFT LAB project, which has provided
          the opportunity to 60 young artists/artisans/designers (30 from Greece
          and 30 from Italy) to combine traditional and innovative skills with
          entrepreneurial abilities, to acquire the tools to improve
          professionally and, as a consequence, to become an example for their
          own colleagues.  Following a public selection process in those various
          areas, open to students and artists aged between 18 and 35 years old,
          6 laboratories were set up to provide experience: 3 in Italy (in
          Grottaglie for ceramics; in Martina Franca for fabrics; in Gravina in
          Puglia for mosaics) and 3 in Greece (in Corfù for ceramics; in Lefkada
          for fabrics; in Kefalonia for mosaics), thus creating a synergic mix
          of arts and trades with the aim of revitalising the artisanal sector
          through the introduction of new technologies, and promoting
          entrepreneurship among the young as well as generating employment
          opportunities in the sector. The workshops were organised in such a
          way as to make available the specific materials and equipment needed
          to create designer products. Lasting four weeks, including two
          exchange weekends with the Greek counterparts, the workshops ended on
          30 November 2019 with all the artists involved in the project
          exhibiting their works in a dedicated exhibition at the Pino Pascali
          Foundation in Polignano a Mare (Bari). The next essential step for the
          creation of an artisanal business, after a feasibility study, a
          marketing plan and a business plan for the establishment of an SME,
          was carried out by the CNA Bari (National Confederation of Crafts and
          Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Association of Bari), and the
          Regional Union of
        </div>
        <div class="intro--col">
          Municipalities of Ionian Islands and the Chamber of Lefkada, the
          project partners, which through the technical support of specialists
          in the sector helped the young entrepreneurs to begin developing their
          entrepreneurial ideas. The result has been the establishment of 6 new
          start-ups, the injection of regional political capital into the
          artisanal sector and the introduction of measures to support the
          economic and commercial sustainability of products of this type - new
          artisanal products with a new shared cross-border brand that can be
          offered to tourists and that can provide a way into new markets,
          reinforcing contacts and cooperation between partners at all levels
          and stimulating integration between peoples through activities, joint
          exhibitions and intercultural learning. The main aim of the Craft Lab
          project was to launch innovative workshops designed to revive old
          trades in the fields of the working of ceramics, mosaics and textiles.
          It would appear that dreams sometimes come true... The CRAFT-LAB
          Project, “Residences on the way from products to the Adri-Ionian
          design” is a Project co-funded by European Union, European Regional
          Development Funds (E.R.D.F.) and by National Funds of Greece and
          Italy. The Pino Pascali Foundation is the lead beneficiary of this
          project in cooperation with two Italian partners the National
          Confederation of Crafts and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
          Association of Bari, (CNA Bari) and Puglia Region, Department of
          Economic Development, Education, Training and Employment, and two
          Greek partners the Regional Union of Municipalities of Ionian
          Islands and the Chamber of Lefkada. The CRAFT-LAB project, financed
          under Priority Axis 1 – Innovation and Competitiveness, with a budget
          of about 1 Million euro, aims to promote entrepreneurship and job
          opportunities by discovering and restoring the ancient arts and
          professions in the ceramic, mosaic and textile fields.

              >REON (from the Greek ρέον, which means moving as in a stream,
              ever-changing) is a multi-disciplinary studio based in Corfu.
              Inspired by the concepts of the endless Greek summer, deep ecology
              and local architectural elements, we focus on the creation of
              small handmade collections of ceramic objects including tableware,
              coffeeware, teaware, artworks and custom pieces. Using a slow
              production model we embrace transparency, the transformative
              beauty of clay and the deep pleasures of imperfect (human)
              nature.  REON Studio also serves as an open space for
              experimentation, research and recreation for local people and
              international artists and designers, through REON’s artist
              residency programme.

            Lefkada (Laws 4019/2011 and 4430/2016) and was born out of our love
            for the arts, culture, history, folklore and people of the island.

          Skiadaresi and Andriana Lazari! Each has a special love for the
          cultural elements of our homeland. Our aim is to convey this love to
          visitors and to the inhabitants of our island <br />
          <br />
          <b>Services:</b> organization of seminars and workshops; highlighting
          and promoting local culture <br /><br />
          <b>Objective:</b> creation of a cultural space in which the spiritual
          culture of Lefkada will be promoted through the organization of
          seminars and workshops <br /><br />
          <b>About us:</b> At THE TRIP we love culture and tradition and we
          decided to do what we love, artisanal work! This is because we believe
          that only when you really love your job can you stand out and be the
          best! Tradition is a process by which morals, customs, knowledge or
          beliefs are passed on from one generation to another and thus
          perpetuated. The cultural elements - tastes, music, arts, crafts - are
          what make each people special and distinctive. Our island, Lefkada, is
          rich in all of these, and they enchant all those who experience them!
          The focus of our business is the promotion of cultural elements to
          visitors to our island through training tourism, experience and
          adventure tourism and through the many and varied aspects of
          alternative Thematic Tourism. The key purpose of our team is to
          publicise and promote Lefkada’s local products and those who produce
          them. By achieving our goals we will also enable our members to
          achieve fulfilment! Join our TRIP to tradition!

            distribution of cultural goods while satisfying the interests and
            needs of the local community of Kefalonia. For the purpose of
            maintaining team work and social cohesion, seminars, workshops and
            educational activities for all ages will be organised and artist
            residencies will be offered. We want to build an artistic network
            that will support local art workers and enhance international
            collaboration in line with the principles of sustainable economics
            and alternative tourism development. <br />
            <br />
            As far as our mosaic work is concerned, we will organise workshops,
            educational programmes and seminars on the history and evolution of
            mosaic art and help new artists to design and create mosaic
            artworks. Mosaics have a long tradition on the island of Kefalonia,
            dating back to Roman times, and, because of its aesthetic, social
            and historical value, engagement with this art form can serve not
            only to influence local artistic production but also to improve
            cohesion in the local community. The artists will use traditional
            mosaic techniques and take account of contemporary trends in the
            field in order to create authentic new works by combining methods
            and materials, thus offering a new perspective on this ancient art
            form. We intend to design and create works of art which can decorate
            commercial or private residential spaces, but what excites us most
            is incorporating mosaic art into public environments, as outdoor
            mosaic projects can transform crowded public areas into creative
            dialogue platforms. <br /><br /><b>About us: </b> Lithostroto is a
            new creative hub, a cultural cooperative located in Argostoli,
            Kefalonia. The main goal of our start-up is to encourage artistic
            expression in any form and in any way possible! We will engage
            mostly with the art of mosaics, but we are more than eager to
            support all kinds of cultural events, exhibitions and educational
            projects, all of which can be planned, staged and managed by our
            team!

          <br />
          <b>About us:</b> Le Moire is a group that uses textiles and weaving
          (in Ancient Greece the Moirai were the goddesses who spun the thread
          of life; for the Romans they were known as the Parcae) to produce
          clothes and accessories inspired by the Mediterranean and Magna
          Graecia, areas historically bound together by a shared past. They make
          garments with elements that customers can add on or interchange as
          they wish. Customers can choose to personalise garments from the basic
          clothing line (designed and packaged by the Moire) by adding pockets,
          collars, sleeves, etc (made on a loom with recycled textiles), all of
          which operations can be easily performed even by those less expert.
          The group organises courses aimed at passing down the traditions of
          their land, such as weaving, and passing on their knowledge in the
          artistic and other fields to all those interested.
