          In many European regions artisanal culture has a long tradition. In
          order to be able to safeguard both Italian and Greek cultural and
          artistic heritage, it is necessary to protect the professions
          connected to culture and traditional craft and to incentivise the
          future development of the cultural and creative industries.  The
          ancient trades have been passed down from generation to generation,
          more in the shape of creative hobbies than entrepreneurial activities.
          This is the background to the CRAFT LAB project, which has provided
          the opportunity to 60 young artists/artisans/designers (30 from Greece
          and 30 from Italy) to combine traditional and innovative skills with
          entrepreneurial abilities, to acquire the tools to improve
          professionally and, as a consequence, to become an example for their
          own colleagues.  Following a public selection process in those various
          areas, open to students and artists aged between 18 and 35 years old,
          6 laboratories were set up to provide experience: 3 in Italy (in
          Grottaglie for ceramics; in Martina Franca for fabrics; in Gravina in
          Puglia for mosaics) and 3 in Greece (in Corfù for ceramics; in Lefkada
          for fabrics; in Kefalonia for mosaics), thus creating a synergic mix
          of arts and trades with the aim of revitalising the artisanal sector
          through the introduction of new technologies, and promoting
          entrepreneurship among the young as well as generating employment
          opportunities in the sector. The workshops were organised in such a
          way as to make available the specific materials and equipment needed
          to create designer products. Lasting four weeks, including two
          exchange weekends with the Greek counterparts, the workshops ended on
          30 November 2019 with all the artists involved in the project
          exhibiting their works in a dedicated exhibition at the Pino Pascali
          Foundation in Polignano a Mare (Bari). The next essential step for the
          creation of an artisanal business, after a feasibility study, a
          marketing plan and a business plan for the establishment of an SME,
          was carried out by the CNA Bari (National Confederation of Crafts and
          Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Association of Bari), and the
          Regional Union of
        </div>
        <div class="intro--col">
          Municipalities of Ionian Islands and the Chamber of Lefkada, the
          project partners, which through the technical support of specialists
          in the sector helped the young entrepreneurs to begin developing their
          entrepreneurial ideas. The result has been the establishment of 6 new
          start-ups, the injection of regional political capital into the
          artisanal sector and the introduction of measures to support the
          economic and commercial sustainability of products of this type - new
          artisanal products with a new shared cross-border brand that can be
          offered to tourists and that can provide a way into new markets,
          reinforcing contacts and cooperation between partners at all levels
          and stimulating integration between peoples through activities, joint
          exhibitions and intercultural learning. The main aim of the Craft Lab
          project was to launch innovative workshops designed to revive old
          trades in the fields of the working of ceramics, mosaics and textiles.
          It would appear that dreams sometimes come true... The CRAFT-LAB
          Project, “Residences on the way from products to the Adri-Ionian
          design” is a Project co-funded by European Union, European Regional
          Development Funds (E.R.D.F.) and by National Funds of Greece and
          Italy. The Pino Pascali Foundation is the lead beneficiary of this
          project in cooperation with two Italian partners the National
          Confederation of Crafts and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
          Association of Bari, (CNA Bari) and Puglia Region, Department of
          Economic Development, Education, Training and Employment, and two
          Greek partners the Regional Union of Municipalities of Ionian
          Islands and the Chamber of Lefkada. The CRAFT-LAB project, financed
          under Priority Axis 1 – Innovation and Competitiveness, with a budget
          of about 1 Million euro, aims to promote entrepreneurship and job
          opportunities by discovering and restoring the ancient arts and
          professions in the ceramic, mosaic and textile fields.

              >REON (from the Greek ρέον, which means moving as in a stream,
              ever-changing) is a multi-disciplinary studio based in Corfu.
              Inspired by the concepts of the endless Greek summer, deep ecology
              and local architectural elements, we focus on the creation of
              small handmade collections of ceramic objects including tableware,
              coffeeware, teaware, artworks and custom pieces. Using a slow
              production model we embrace transparency, the transformative
              beauty of clay and the deep pleasures of imperfect (human)
              nature.  REON Studio also serves as an open space for
              experimentation, research and recreation for local people and
              international artists and designers, through REON’s artist
              residency programme.
